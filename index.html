<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <br>I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the 
  <a href="https://wiot.northeastern.edu">Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things</a>, 
  where I work on Channel Coding. My research interests lie in Information Theory, Quantum Error Correction, 
  Wireless Communications, and Machine Learning.<br><br>

  Previously, I was a PhD student at 
  <a href="https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/">Bilkent University</a>, working under the supervision of Prof. 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdal_Ar%C4%B1kan">Erdal ArÄ±kan</a>.
	The main focus of my study was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_code_(coding_theory)">polar</a>-like codes.
	
	
  <br><br>

  I have held several postdoctoral research positions at prestigious institutions, collaborating with leading experts in my field. 
  At Northeastern University, I worked with Dr. 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=mZMaDgEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Hessam Mahdavifar</a>; 
  at New Mexico State University (NMSU), I worked with Dr. 
  <a href="https://www.mitchellcoding.com/">David G. M. Mitchell</a>; 
  and at Bilkent University, I worked with Prof. 
  <a href="http://ctar.bilkent.edu.tr/index.php/tolga-m-duman/">Tolga M. Duman</a> on various engaging projects.

	<li><i>January 2024:</i> My paper is published in Finite Fields and Their Applications, titled "Polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes as a concatenation of inner cyclic and outer polar- and Reed-Muller-like codes." 
		In this study, I show that PAC codes are equivalent to a new class of codes consisting of inner cyclic codes and outer polar- and Reed-Muller-like codes. 
		I use the properties of cyclic codes to establish that PAC codes outperform polar- and Reed-Muller-like codes in terms of minimum distance. 
		Cyclic codes are a well-studied class of codes, and the newly introduced concatenated methods yield the favorable weight distribution of PAC codes. 
		One can study the decoding of these codes or explore new ways to investigate the weight distribution of polar-like codes.

	<li><i>May 2023:</i> My paper, "Application of Guessing to Sequential Decoding of Polarization-Adjusted Convolutional (PAC) Codes," is published in IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM). 
		This paper introduces a necessary criterion for the rate profile of polar-like codes to enable low-complexity sequential decoding. 
		I am working to show that this is also a sufficient condition.
		This condition can also be applied to the SCL decoding of polar codes.
