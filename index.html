    <strong>We solved a fundamental problem in channel coding in our paper, 
      <i>PAC Codes with Bounded-Complexity Sequential Decoding: Pareto Distribution and Code Design</i>, 
      available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06072" target="_blank">arXiv</a></strong>.
    In this work, we address a key challenge in channel coding related to the computational complexity of sequential decoding.
    For convolutional codes, it is known that if the number of transmitted data symbols is less than NR<sub>0</sub>, 
    where R<sub>0</sub> is the channel cutoff rate, the decoding complexity remains constant. 
    However, when the data size exceeds NR<sub>0</sub>, the required computation grows exponentially.
    PAC codes, which combine polar and convolutional coding, experience this behavior in a different way. 
    After the first step of channel polarization, half of the channels (N/2) are "bad" channels with a cutoff rate R<sub>0</sub><sup>-</sup>, 
    and the other half are "good" channels with a cutoff rate R<sub>0</sub><sup>+</sup>.
    In <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10138089" target="_blank">an earlier paper</a>, 
    I proved that if the data size in each half of the rate profile exceeds (N/2)R<sub>0</sub><sup>-</sup> and (N/2)R<sub>0</sub><sup>+</sup>, 
    the decoding complexity grows exponentially. In this current work, we have solved the inverse problem&mdash;
    showing that if the data size is below these thresholds, the decoding complexity remains constant.
    It is important to note the gap between the cutoff rate R<sub>0</sub> and the channel capacity I(W). 
    For convolutional codes operating at rates between these values, decoding complexity is exponential. 
    However, after one step of polarization, we observe that the average cutoff rate is higher than R<sub>0</sub> 
    (i.e., (R<sub>0</sub><sup>-</sup> + R<sub>0</sub><sup>+</sup>) / 2 &ge; R<sub>0</sub>), while the average capacity remains unchanged 
    (i.e., (I(W<sup>-</sup>) + I(W<sup>+</sup>)) / 2 = I(W)). This implies that after just one polarization step, it is possible to send data at rates 
    closer to the channel capacity with constant decoding complexity.
    As we further polarize the channel, we can achieve transmission rates even closer to the channel capacity while maintaining constant decoding complexity. 
    Our numerical results show that for small to medium block lengths, PAC codes offer error-correction performance close to theoretical bounds, with a decoding complexity that remains constant.
    The next question we aim to explore is how to optimally design PAC codes for list decoding.

		In this study, I show that PAC codes are equivalent to a new class of codes consisting of inner cyclic codes and outer polar- and Reed-Muller-like codes. 
		I use the properties of cyclic codes to establish that PAC codes outperform polar- and Reed-Muller-like codes in terms of minimum distance. 
		Cyclic codes are a well-studied class of codes, and the newly introduced concatenated methods yield the favorable weight distribution of PAC codes. 
		One can study the decoding of these codes or explore new ways to investigate the weight distribution of polar-like codes.

		This condition can also be applied to the SCL decoding of polar codes.

		The results demonstrate a significant advantage for PAC codes over both convolutional and 5G polar codes, particularly in short block-length regimes. 
		Additionally, our numerical results indicate that the complexity of sequential decoding for PAC codes follows a Pareto distribution.
